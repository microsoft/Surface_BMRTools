* If you want to post install a latest cumulative update (LCU), please download LCU from [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=cumulative%20update%2024h2), please don't put mutiple \*.msu files into same folder becasue it can cause installation failures, please copy \*.msu files to separate folders in order under D:\sources\postdeploy\updates, like D:\sources\postdeploy\updates\0\\\*.msu, D:\sources\postdeploy\updates\1\\\*.msu, ...

* If you want to post install drivers, please download drivers' msi from [Manage & deploy Surface driver & firmware updates - Surface | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/manage-surface-driver-and-firmware-updates#download-and-install-updates), please use msiexec to expand msi file like below, and then copy drivers you want to install from SurfaceUpdate sub folder under msi expanded destination to D:\sources\postdeploy\drivers
```powershell
msiexec /a "C:\Path\To\Installer.msi" /qb TARGETDIR="C:\Path\To\ExtractedFiles"
```

* Please connect the usbkey to the surface device you have to install surface recovery image with postdeploy supported after above steps done

* Please collect logs C:\\\$SysReset\Logs\setupact.log, D:\sources\postdeploy\StartPostDeploy.log and D:\sources\postdeploy\StartPostDeploy.err to double check if postdeploy succeeded as expected, the existence of D:\sources\postdeploy\StartPostDeploy.err means there are postdeploy failures.

# Known issues
* If you put KB5043080 and latest LCU into same folder under <usbroot>\sources\postdeploy\updates, KB5043080 installation will fail
* Removing existing higher version drivers is not supported, if you want to post install lower version drivers please customize StartPostDeploy.ps1 by yourself
